# Deno app test

My Deno (+ drash) app.

From my testing, you can start deno pretty easy, if you already has javascript knowledge (you don't even need node.js knowledge!). But, because  their modules (packages as called in node.js) is lacky compared to node.js. So, if it has more package it might be more pleasant to use. (I quite like it tho.)

## running

```bash
deno run --allow-net app.ts
```
